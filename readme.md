    - **Yellow Locked Doors**: Require a Key or a Bomb to open.
    - **Red Forced Doors**: Lock when enemies are present. Use a Bomb to force them open if you need a quick escape!
- **Ammo System**:
    - Weapons have different ammo types:
        - **Reload**: Mag + Reserve. Reloads automatically when empty.
        - **Recharge**: Infinite ammo that recharges over time after depletion.
        - **Finite**: Ammo depletes until empty. "OUT OF AMMO".
- **Items**:
    - **Keys**: Open locked doors.
    - **Bombs**: Replenish your bomb supply.
    - **Health Potions**: Restore HP.
