levels
    level 1 is a basic intro
    level 2 is golcen path maze (it will say room name followed by dejavu)
    level 3 is harder level one

    level 6 unlocks permanance (if enable permeane mode you can do the sweet modifiers but the whole game becomes harder as a result)


logic
    reload gun / bomb when they pick up a new item
    if you get hit perfect bonus will reset 
    show gun name in the UI

bombs
    add an explode on enemy / anything 


level 1

    implemebt new and save game (use sqllite to store the game data)
    the second time you will have doors
    each time you finish the game you will unlock more stuff

player 
    triangle should rotate to be the point the way you are moving
    iron man mode (ooe hit dead, all modifiers reset) (require save first)
    if speed is over 2 x starting speed show a blur effect
    gemoetry gun shows triangle, square etc
    peashooter shows peashooter
    


bullets  
    cosine gun

enemies
    have enemies be able to use bullets
    have swarm enemies that run away unless there are x of them
    have run away enemies
    last enemy tougher
    add enemy hit and enemy death sound   from json

mini map
    item should show the whole mini map

    whole mini map should be shown always (is this true we have a button which will show the full map)
    make rooms go golden if you follow the golden path as a later level will be random rooms that get harder and harder everytime you go off the golden path and enemies respawn in rooms.
