    add const paths to the json files so we dont require absolute urls as this can lead to errors

    going to main menu and starting a new game keeps gun modifiers once you pick up a new gun, you correctly start with the peashooter or unarmed

Balance
    implement seed system to regenerate exact level so we can debug whilst the boss room does not always spawn
    count the number of dead enemies and show on dead complete screen, scroll the dead enemy types up
    add a timer (as unlock and store time for each level)
        This will be the first thing we store on the server we will store the players name, level and time and have a speed run leaderboard
    drops should take into account the room hardness of the room and the player modifiers to incrase the pool chances of dropping to help with balancing 
    rather than add the rooms to the json of level instead add a maxHardnes and maxRooms to decide the rooms that go into the level (you could even factor in the player modifiers)
    peermant unlocks can be purchased for red shards you collect once you unlock permance mode you can pay to buy any item you unlocked 
    beat the game to unlock permance mode 
    so you cna buy the item you want for the next run you can also get really expensive items that are permanent upgrades so upgrades are permanent and active when you start a new run such as enemy names
    Add a canPickUp flag to enemy Json to steal and use your spawned items and guns 
    using the follow mechanic, gun modifier, canhurtplayer (set to false) and canhurt enemies (set to true) we can create pets that follow you and shoot at enemies
    Add a charisma stat / item that can be used to turn enemies into pets / friends useful for the pacacifer runs
    add a mechanic for the passiver run the boss room to open the portal i am thinking of standing on tile(s) for a set amount of time and / or in a set sequence
    enemies have a happy mode where they run around and jump for joy and add hp to you if you hit them 
    enemies have a dazed mode theres eyes turn to circles and they run away from the player for a few seconds
    enemies have a confused mode and they attack each other 
    enemy can randomly be scared and they run away out of the room,  You fimd these enemies in the bnss room explaining their cowardice and they attack in the boss battle which shouting 
    
    "WITNESS ME"

    to which the boss always responds

    "MEDICORE"

    if there is a secret in the room some enemies will quickly look in its direction the look away after a second or two

ghost
    when you drop a bomb inside the ghost when it eats you as its not solid it never explodes (maybe kick mechanic is firing)
    another ghost spawens every 10 seconds if you dont kill the first ghost ghost timer should stop when the ghost spawns (only ever spawns max 2 ghosts)
    ghost non solid enmeies should be able to pass through bombs (they dont explode)
    ghost appears when you stay on th ewelcoem screen for 10 seconds stopping ghost from spawining in start room will fix this 
    ghost does not appear in boss rooms
    if you go through multiple room and back track you will see multiple ghosts
    if you leave a room and come back the ghost should be the same place + closer to you basedo on the speed the ghost moves. 
    if you kill some of the enemeis and leave a room and back there should only be the remaining enemies left (with ghost or blowing doors)
    door is gone
    ghost timer is running when you are on the welcome screen
